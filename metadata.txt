name=KAT Analyse - Overlap area (Multi-Types)
qgisMinimumVersion=3.22
description=Spatial analysis plugin that detects and classifies geometric anomalies for points, lines and polygons (duplicates, topology issues, overlaps). Includes adaptive modes and full export features.
about=KAT Analyse - Overlap area is a spatial quality-control tool that automatically adapts its detection rules to the geometry type. It identifies overlaps, intersections, duplicates and topological inconsistencies, and provides detailed reports and visualization tools.
